# cudaRayTrace
Base of the code is pretty much copied and adapted from Ray Tracing in a Weekend by Peter Shirley, with one loop's iteration taken from an Nvidia Dev Blog attempting the same project.

Most recent work is in adding materials and optimizing hit search for large triangle searches (check KD branch for latest).
